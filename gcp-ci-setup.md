Step-by-Step Instructions to Set Up CircleCI CI Pipeline
Step 1: Prerequisites
CircleCI Account: Make sure you have a CircleCI account. If not, sign up at CircleCI.
VCS Connection: Ensure your Version Control System (VCS), such as GitHub or Bitbucket, is connected to your CircleCI account.
Project Repository: Ensure you have a project repository that you want to set up with CircleCI.
Step 2: Create .circleci Directory
In your project root directory, create a new directory named .circleci.
Within the .circleci directory, create a file named config.yml. This file will house your CircleCI pipeline configuration.
Step 3: Set Up Initial Configuration
Open the config.yml file.
Define the version of CircleCI you are using (typically version 2.1 or 2.0).
Step 4: Define Jobs
Job Definition: CircleCI jobs define a series of steps to be executed. At a minimum, define jobs for the essential CI tasks, like testing and deployment.
Each job can run in a unique environment (Docker, VM, etc.).
Step 5: Define Pipeline Stages (Workflows)
Workflows: Workflows define how and when jobs run.
In the config.yml file, define your workflow stages - typically including stages like build, test, and deploy.
Step 6: Configure and Optimize Each Job
Environment Configuration: Specify the environment each job will use (e.g., Docker image, VM instance).
Commands: List the commands and scripts to be executed in each job.
Caching: Utilize caching to optimize your jobs and reduce build times (e.g., caching dependency folders).
Step 7: Commit and Push Configuration
Commit the .circleci/config.yml file to your repository.
Push the commit to trigger CircleCI, which will automatically detect the config.yml file and start the CI pipeline.
Example Configuration Outline
Here's an outline to help you structure your config.yml file:

Version Declaration:

version: 2.1
Define Jobs:

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:12
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm build

  test:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:12
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test

  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:12
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run deploy

    jobs:
      - build
      - test:
          requires:
            - build
      - deploy:
          requires:
            - test
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main
Step-by-Step Summary:
Create Project Configuration: Set up .circleci/config.yml in your project.
Define Pipeline Version: Specify the version of CircleCI configuration.
Define Jobs: Create individual jobs for build, test, and deploy.
Configure Workflows: Link these jobs in a workflow with dependencies.
