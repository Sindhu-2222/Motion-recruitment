***Initial Setup
*Create an Azure DevOps Account:
-Sign up for an Azure DevOps account if you donâ€™t have one.
-Create a new Azure DevOps organization or use an existing one.
*Create a New Project:
-In your Azure DevOps organization, create a new project to host your pipeline.
-Repository Setup
-Add Your Code to the Repository:
-Navigate to Repos in your project.
-Create a new repository or use an existing one.
-Commit your application code to this repository.
-Configure the CI Pipeline
*Go to Pipelines:
-Navigate to Pipelines on the left sidebar.
*Create a New Pipeline:
-Click New Pipeline.
-Follow the prompts to connect your repository (choose Azure Repos Git if your code is there, or connect to other Git providers like GitHub).
*Select YAML Configuration:
-Opt for using a YAML file to define your pipeline.
-Azure DevOps can generate a sample azure-pipelines.yml file. You will customize this file according to your setup.
**Define Pipeline Stages

Build Stage:
Install necessary tools and dependencies: In your YAML file, define steps to set up the environment and install dependencies (e.g., for a Python project, use pip to install required packages from requirements.txt).
Test Stage:
Run tests: Define steps to execute your test suite (e.g., run unit tests using a framework like pytest).
Deploy Stage:
Deploy the Application: Define steps to deploy your application to an Azure VM or other services as required.
Example Pipeline Stages Documentation:
Checkout the Code:

Use the checkout step to get the code from the repository.
Build Environment:

Setup the environment (e.g., setting up a virtual environment for Python).
Build:

Build the application (e.g., package the application if needed).
Test:

Run the test suite.
Deploy:

Use deployment steps (e.g., SSH into an Azure VM and deploy the build).
YAML Configuration Outline:
Example:
yaml
Copy Code


trigger:
- main  # Automatically trigger builds on changes to the 'main' branch

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- script: python -m venv env            # Setup virtual environment
  displayName: 'Set up Python environment'

- script: |
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  displayName: 'Install dependencies'

- script: |
    source env/bin/activate
    python -m pytest
  displayName: 'Run tests'

- script: |
    source env/bin/activate
    python setup.py build
  displayName: 'Build application'

- script: |
    ssh user@your-azure-vm 'bash -s' < deploy-script.sh
  displayName: 'Deploy to Azure VM'
Configure Build Triggers:
Set Up Triggers:
In the pipeline YAML or through the Azure DevOps UI, configure triggers to automatically start builds on code changes.
